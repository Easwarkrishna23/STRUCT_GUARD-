"""
Defense Step 2 — Feature Smoothing.

Goal: Suppress adversarial noise injected into node features.

Method:
    X' = A_hat @ X

  One step of graph-based diffusion propagates each node's features
  as a weighted average of its neighbours' features.

Effect:
  - Isolated adversarial spikes in a single node's features get averaged
    out by clean neighbours (neighbourhood majority vote).
  - Nodes with many clean neighbours recover faster.
  - Works on both feature perturbation and gradient-based attacks.

Note: Uses the PRUNED adjacency (from Step 1), not the original.
This ensures adversarial edges do not participate in smoothing.
