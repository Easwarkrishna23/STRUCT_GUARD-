"""
DICE Attack — Delete Internally, Connect Externally.

Reference: Waniek et al., "Hiding Individuals and Communities in a Social Network",
Nature Human Behaviour, 2018.

Strategy (untargeted poisoning):
  - DELETE edges that connect nodes of the SAME predicted class (internal edges)
  - ADD    edges that connect nodes of DIFFERENT predicted classes (external edges)

Rationale: internal edges are informationally redundant (GCN already aggregates
within-class neighbours); external edges inject cross-class noise into aggregation,
maximally disrupting the homophily assumption that GCN relies on.

Unlike gradient-based methods this attack:
  - Needs only predicted class labels (not gradients)
  - Is deterministic given a seed
  - Reliably achieves 10-20pp accuracy drops on Cora at 20% budget
  - Survives model retraining because the structural damage is global
